# Let's Note

The all-in-one note for your brain.

## Features

- I can see an empty state when there are no notes
- I can create a new note
- I can see all my notes on the sidebar (usually on the left)
- I can switch between past notes which display the selected note for me to edit
- My text changes are autosaved without me having to click Submit or Save (note: it's OK if you want to add a Save button for now to prioritize other features)
- Show as gallery (ongoing)
- Show as list
- Truncate note's title and description
- If note created today, it would show time too
- Mouse change when hover detail, list and buttons
- Don't worry when you close your browser or your pc is restarted, I saved your note in local storage already.
- Promise, I will sync all your devices (will do).

## Update 1.0.1

- I have sync across your devices.
- you can create an account and let me sync (need to find out why login screen is so long).
